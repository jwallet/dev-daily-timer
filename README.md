### Timer for developers that logs the number of hours worked.

Keep track of time spent at work on a task
- by using the afk / lockscreen feature:
   - It resumes the timer when active
   - It pauses the timer when you are afk (to a meeting, e.g. your daily scrum). 
- by using the controls: pause, resume and reset the timer at any time.

Use the settings to customize it your way.
